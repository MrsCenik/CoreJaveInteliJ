       What is encapsulation?
       Reduce complexity, increase reusability
       Encapsulation is a process used to protect and hide data.
       Preventing other classes from accessing directly the instance variable
       Data Hiding Process is called "Encapsulation"
       We group related variables and functions that operate on them into objects
       accessing results while hiding data
       For example, while riding a bike you know that if you raise the accelerator, you increase the speed but you do not know how does it work
       Getters method is used to read the encapsulated data while setters method is used to update the data
     */
    
    
    /*
      How do you hide data?
      Using "private" access modifier
     */
    
    /*
      How do you access hidden data from other classes?
      create getter and setter
      to read data---> getter
      to update data---> setter
     */
    
    /*
      What is immutable class?
      The class we can not update
      We use just getter method
      No need to create setter
      Our variables should be private but not the class
     */
    
    /*
     What should be the return types for getter and setter?
     for setter---> void
     for getter---> int, String, double,...all but void
     */
    
    /*
      What are the features of encapsulation?/
      Reusability
      flexibility
      Maintenance
      reduction of complexity
      Combine the data of our application and its manipulation at one place
